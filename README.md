### Hi there, I'm Sarah! 👋
<img align="right" width="200" height="200" src="https://sarah-hart-landolt.github.io/assets/images/SHL%20LOGO%20CODING1.png"></a>
- 💃🏻 I'm a software developer, an abstract artist, and a former French teacher who is often wearing red lipstick (hence my logo to the right) and drinking La Croix.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Android while sharpening my skills in C#, JavaScript, and React. 
- 💻 Check out these two Apps that I built from scratch and am most proud of:
     - [Paris-Passe-Partout](https://github.com/sarah-hart-landolt/Paris-Passe-Partout) 
     - [Feeling Heart](https://github.com/sarah-hart-landolt/Feeling-Heart-Chart)
- 📫 How to reach me: sarah.hart.landolt@gmail.com || [Dev Portfolio](https://sarah-hart-landolt.github.io/) || [Artist Site](https://www.sarahhartlandolt.com/)
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I won "Best Hair" from my cohort at Nashville Software School due to my wild, untamable curly mane. 
     - Developers.OrderBy(dev => dev.HairSize).Last())
